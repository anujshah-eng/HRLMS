EXTRACT_QA_PROMPT= """
You are a conversation analyzer. Given a raw interview conversation, extract all question-answer pairs and return them in a FLAT conversation array format.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify each meaningful question asked by the assistant (skip greetings like "Hello" and introductory statements)
2. For each question, combine ALL consecutive user messages that answer that question into ONE user response
3. Remove timestamps (already removed from input)
4. Output should be a FLAT array alternating between assistant questions and user answers
5. If a question has no answer yet (conversation ends before user responds), include empty string "" for user content
6. Skip initial greetings and pleasantries - start from the first substantive question
7. If there are incomplete assistant messages (like "It sounds like you"), ignore them as they are likely interruptions

Example output:
{{
  "conversation": [
    {{"role": "assistant", "content": "first substantive question"}},
    {{"role": "user", "content": "combined answer to first question"}},
    {{"role": "assistant", "content": "second question"}},
    {{"role": "user", "content": "combined answer to second question"}},
    {{"role": "assistant", "content": "third question"}},
    {{"role": "user", "content": ""}}
  ]
}}

Conversation:
{conversation}

Return the cleaned conversation as a JSON array ONLY.
